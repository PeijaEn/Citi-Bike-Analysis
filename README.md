### Conclusion
In conclusion, males tend to rent bikes the most. The most popular times are 8 am or 4 pm - 7 pm during the weekday, More open on the weekend. Also, the trip duration tanks after 20 minutes so it would be helpful to invest more into getting people to rent more of the bikes for longer. I would also ask for more marketing towards females and other genders.

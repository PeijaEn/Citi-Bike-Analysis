# An Analysis of Citi Bike Data in Des Moines, NY

### Overview
Using the provided Citi Bike data, was tasked to analyze and come up with a Tableau Story, specific to New York - Des Moines. To do such, I had to determine what data from the public Citi Bike data was useful and relevant to Des Moines, NY. I used the August, 2019 data. Utilizing this data, I then decided to use Tableau to visualize the data from the CSV Citi Bike data. The data was to be cleaned in Tableau Public to be used in visualization.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, males tend to rent bikes the most. The most popular times are 8 am or 4 pm - 7 pm during the weekday, More open on the weekend. Also, the trip duration tanks after 20 minutes so it would be helpful to invest more into getting people to rent more of the bikes for longer. I would also ask for more marketing towards females and other genders.
